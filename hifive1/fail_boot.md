when there is a dead loop, the hifive1 board will not be connected again.

To solve this:

To activate "safe" boot mode, press the RESET button. When the green LED flashes, immediately press the RESET button again. After 1 second, the red LED will blink. The user program will not
execute, and the programmer can connect. To exit "safe" boot mode, press the RESET button a final time.
